        Your task is to create a one-line message for the following Twitter user in the format of the following: 
        
        “Hi @_______, I noticed you have an interest in _______, and thought I would reach out”

        Replace the '@______' with the Twitter user's UserName, and replace the second blank space with either the word 'writing', with 25% probability, 'reading' with 25% probability or a personalised word based on their bio/tweets with 50% probability. Do not change the format or append any words to this format. Do not use any hashtags. If the sentence does not make grammatical sense with the personalised word from their bio or tweets, then just use the word 'writing'. Avoid any poitical, religious, non-english or potentially offensive words.
